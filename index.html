        <h2>Psithurism</h2>
        <p>Nature Is Love . . .
            We think that trees can't talk.BUt...they can. When the wind rustles the leaves, the trees seem to be whispering the secrets of the universe. Psithurism, the sound of the wind in the trees, is an obsolete word derived from the Greek word for whispering.

        <h2>Petrichor</h2>
        <p>Do you ever feel the earthy smell that follows a rainfall? Especially after the weather has been warm and dry, the earth releases a pleasant smell that some people love. The word’s origins are Greek, derived from combining the Greek word for stone and ichor, the blood of mythological gods. Here’s a quote from Somewhere Only We Know by Alexander Thian: “That’s petrichor. It’s the most comforting scent. When the rain meets the Earth, memories rise. . .”

        <h2>Moonglade and Moonwake</h2>
        <p>You might see moonglade in the lines of poems such as this one by Edgar Rice Burroughs, “Heaven was full of silent stars, and there was a moonglade on the water that stretched almost from him to Rose.” While a moonglade is a flash of moonlight reflecting on water, its synonym moonwake is a great word to describe how the moon’s reflection on the water seems to follow you as you walk along the shore.
            <br>
            Everything we do is dependent on the natural world. We entirely rely on water, air, and fire for our life. The natural resources and the beauty of nature provides a sense of comfort to us.
